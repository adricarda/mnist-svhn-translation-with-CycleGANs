# mnist svhn translation with CycleGANs

Image to image translation using CycleGANs in Tensorflow 2.0. 
Three different implementations are available: the first two are slighly simpler architectures and they use NS GAN and LS GAN as loss function respectively. The last architecture is more similar to the one describred in the original paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593].

For more information, please read the report.
